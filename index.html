            Spider-Man is an MCU (Marvel Cinamatic Universe) character that is one their best characters. Even fans of other characters have to admit that he is one of the most powerful characters. He has wisecracking jokes so good that some his foes could go jail lsughing with tears in their eyes! He is smart enough to impress Tony Stark, the smartest character in the MCU. His web-slinger designs were so good that Stark even copied them! He is good and Chemistry and physics which helped him make the initial design of his web shooters. He was able to hold of Thanos for a lot of time with wisecracking the entire time. He was even able to face Electro who is powerful enough to shoot out beams of pure electricity. He was even able to beat Maw who could manipulate reality. He was able to kill Magneto singhandedly without even looking! If tried to name all his foes then he would take weeks! He helf an entire army of titans to buy the other Avengers for some time. He was so powerful that the Infinity gaunlet and to temporarily kill him! He even was able to face the Avengers and stole Captain America sheild which no other Avenger was able to do. He took down Ant-Man in his giant form too, which is difficult. He even beet an entire army of killer drones with just a sign and a camera! All taken for acouted he is the best MCU character ever. The reason he wanted to be a hero was because right after he got his power his Uncle Ben died which was difficult for him since he was one of the few relatives Peter had left. He was orphan because his parents died in a crash. Afterwards he made his first suit and advanced it untill Tony Stark searched for him and gave him a more advanced suit which used during in the Avengers Civil War and later to fight crime up untill his duty in the Endgame as he played the vital part of delivering the Nano Gaunlet. So that proves why Spider-Man is the best super-hero ever.
